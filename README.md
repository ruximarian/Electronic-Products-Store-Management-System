# Electronic-Products-Store-Management-System

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is a **C++ application** designed for managing an **electronic products store**, handling **inventory, customer orders, and sales transactions**. It supports adding, editing, and deleting products while maintaining an organized database for customer interactions.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Product Management** – Add, edit, and remove products (phones, TVs)  
✅ **Customer Orders** – Place and process customer orders  
✅ **Inventory Tracking** – Maintain a structured product catalog  
✅ **Binary File Storage** – Save and load data efficiently  
✅ **Error Handling** – Ensure data integrity with exception handling  

## 🏛️ Project Structure  

### 📦 **Product Management**  
- Supports two main categories: **Phones** and **TVs**  
- Tracks product details: **price, warranty, brand, specifications**  

### 👤 **Customer Management**  
- Handles **customer registration, order creation, and order processing**  
- Stores customer details securely  

### 📑 **Order Processing**  
- Customers can **add items to cart** and place an order  
- Orders are stored in a **binary file** for persistence  

### 💾 **Binary File Management**  
- Products and orders are **saved and loaded** using binary files  
- Ensures data is retained between program executions  

## 🔧 Technologies Used  
- **C++** for object-oriented programming  
- **File Handling** (binary read/write) for persistent data storage  
- **Exception Handling** for input validation  
- **Singleton Design Pattern** for global instance management  

## 📜 How to Run  
1️⃣ **Compile the project** using a C++ compiler (G++ or MSVC)  
2️⃣ **Run the executable** and follow the menu prompts  
3️⃣ **Manage the store** by adding/editing/deleting products  
4️⃣ **Process customer orders** and generate reports  

## 📈 Results & Benefits
